# Emaar Properties Valuation Project

**Fundamental Analysis Using DCF and Multiples Valuation**  
**Prepared By:** Arsen Tagibekov
**Date:** April 2025

---

## Project Summary
This project presents a full-scale fundamental valuation of **Emaar Properties PJSC**, one of the leading real estate developers in the Middle East. The valuation is based on a fully integrated **3-statement financial model**, along with both **Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)** and **Multiples Valuation** methodologies. 

The objective is to estimate Emaar's intrinsic value using scenario-based forecasting and benchmark it against industry peers, offering a structured investment view supported by rigorous financial modeling.

---

## Methods Used
- **DCF Valuation** with 3 scenarios (Optimistic, Base, Worst)
- **WACC:** 8.5%
- **Terminal Growth Rate:** 0.5%
- **Multiples Valuation** using EV/Revenue and EV/EBIT
- **Peer Group:** Aldar Properties (UAE), Sun Hung Kai (HK), Mitsui Fudosan (JP)

## ðŸ§¾ Key Results
| Methodology    | EV (AED Bn) | EV (USD Bn) |
|----------------|-------------|-------------|
| DCF - Optimistic | 286.03      | 77.87       |
| DCF - Base       | 222.43      | 60.56       |
| DCF - Worst      | 187.27      | 50.99       |
| Multiples Range  | 97.8â€“134.8  | 26.6â€“36.7   |

> *Exchange Rate: 1 USD = 3.673 AED*

The triangulated valuation range highlights that Emaar is currently **undervalued** based on both intrinsic and relative measures.
